I'm a contributor of serval open-source projects. Please join us if you're interested in them: [Jenkins CLI](https://github.com/jenkins-zh/jenkins-cli), [kubsphere](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere). You might be interested in open-source too, feel free to collaborate with me to build up [the open-source participant best practice](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/open-source-best-practice).

[CLI](https://github.com/topics/cli) always can make us be more efficent ðŸš€. For example, I can type less words via [ks](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/ks) when I manipulate [kubeSphere](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere). Another case is that, you might stuck with cloning a amazing open source project due the the network issues. I don't want to waste my time, so I created [cgit](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/cgit) which can clone the code by [a GitHub proxy](http://github.com.cnpmjs.org/).

If you also intrested in creating a CLI by Golang. I'd recommend you use [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra). It's very popular and powerful. But in many cases, you still need [some extension](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/cobra-extension) of it. Futher more, you can add [command alias](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/go-cli-alias/) and [plugin mechanism](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/go-cli-plugin) for your CLI.

[Selenium](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/) is a wonderful project which can help us to do the UI testing work. It's very important to do as many as possible tests before a Pull Request getting merged. For example, I have [an automatic UI testing project](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/ks-ui-test) to do that kind of things. Actually it's super simple, I don't need to take care of a lot details of Selenium. Because I have [an awesome Selenium framework](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/phoenix.webui.framework).

Want to make a friend with me? Make a connection in social media platforms (such as [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linuxsuren/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linuxsuren)) with me might be the first step.
