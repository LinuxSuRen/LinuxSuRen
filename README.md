### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a contributor of serval open-source projects. Please join us if you're interested in them: [Jenkins CLI](https://github.com/jenkins-zh/jenkins-cli), [kubsphere](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere). You might be interested in open-source too, feel free to collaborate with me to build up [the open-source participant best practice](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/open-source-best-practice).

[CLI](https://github.com/topics/cli) always can make us be more efficent ðŸš€. For example, I can type less words via [ks](https://github.com/kubesphere-sigs/ks) when I manipulate [kubeSphere](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere). Or you can use [this tool](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/http-downloader/) to install a package from GitHub release.

I love to share my ideas in [public speaking](public-speaking/README.md). Want to make a friend with me? Make a connection in social media platforms (such as [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linuxsuren/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linuxsuren)) with me might be the first step.
