I'm a contributor of serval open-source projects. Please join us if you're interested in them: [Jenkins CLI](https://github.com/jenkins-zh/jenkins-cli), [kubsphere](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere).

[CLI](https://github.com/topics/cli) always can make us be more efficent 🚀. For example, I can type less words via [ks](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/ks) when I manipulate [kubsphere](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere). Another case is that, you might stuck with cloning a amazing open source project due the the network issues. I don't want to waste my time, so I created [cgit](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/cgit) which can clone the code by [a GitHub proxy](http://github.com.cnpmjs.org/).

If you also intrested in creating a CLI by Golang. I'd recommend you use [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra). It's very popular and powerful. But in many cases, you still need [some extension](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/cobra-extension) of it. Futher more, you can add [command alias](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/go-cli-alias/) and [plugin mechanism](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen/go-cli-plugin) for your CLI.
